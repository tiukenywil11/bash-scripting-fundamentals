# ./6-man.sh ls
COMMAND=$1
# Open the manual page for ls using a pager that quits automatically
man -P cat $COMMAND
# Notes from ChatGPT:
# 1. The default pager for man is usually less, but you can specify a different pager using the -P option. Here are a few examples of pagers that you can use:
#      - cat: This is a simple pager that just displays the contents of the file and then exits. It doesn't allow for scrolling or searching, but it's useful if you just want to quickly see the contents of a file.
#      - more: This is an older pager that is similar to less, but it doesn't have as many features. It only allows you to scroll forward through the file, and you can't scroll back or search.
#      - most: This is a pager that is similar to less, but it has some additional features like mouse support and the ability to view multiple files at once.
#      - lv: This is a pager that displays files in a graphical interface, with colors and highlighting to make it easier to read.
#      - vim: This is a pager that opens the file in the vim text editor. This allows you to not only read the file, but also to edit it if needed.
